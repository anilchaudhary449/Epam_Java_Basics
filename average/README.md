# Average

The purpose of this exercise is to train you to use simple loops and conditional statements.

Estimated workload of this exercise is _20 min_.

### Description

Please, proceed to [Average](src/main/java/com/epam/rd/autotasks/Average.java) class
and write a program that reads a sequence of integer values from standard input and finds the average value.

Details:

- You must read sequence values until the next one is `0`. Zero value means end of the input sequence.
- The sequence is guaranteed to contain at least one value.
- Average value is also an **integer**. Use **integer** operations.
