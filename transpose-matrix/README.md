# Matrix transposition

The purpose of this exercise is to train you to work with arrays.

Estimated workload of this exercise is _45 min_.

### Description
Please, proceed to [`TransposeMatrix`](src/main/java/com/epam/rd/autotasks/matrices/TransposeMatrix.java)
class an implement its method `multiply`. 

It takes a rectangular integer array (matrix) as a parameter and returns it transposed.

Consider an integer matrix represented as a **rectangular array**. 
The task is to **transpose** a given matrix over its main diagonal. 
The **transposition** of a matrix over its main diagonal is simply a flipped version of the original matrix.

### Example
Input:  

      {
         {0, 1, 2}, 
         {3, 4, 5}, 
         {6, 7, 8}
      }

Output: 
 
      {
         {0, 3, 6}, 
         {1, 4, 7}, 
         {2, 5, 8}
      }
