# Find the maximum integer in a sequence

The purpose of this exercise is to train you to use simple loops and conditional statements.

Estimated workload of this exercise is _20 min_.

### Description

Please, proceed to [FindMaxInSeq](src/main/java/com/epam/rd/autotasks/sequence/FindMaxInSeq.java)
and write a program that reads a sequence of integer values from standard output and finds the maximum value. You must
place your solution into the `max`  method to pass tests.

Details:

- You must read sequence values until the next one is `0`. Zero value means end of the input sequence.
- The sequence is guaranteed to contain at least one value.

### Example

Input:

```
2 4 6 9 2 4 5 0
```

Output:

```
9
```
